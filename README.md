# Clingo Tenner Grid Solver
Python implementation of the Tenner Grid logic puzzle with automated solving using the power of answer set programming and Clingo.

Presently, the solver only works for 10x3 grids (with the 3rd row being the sum row), but I am working on making it work more generally for the maximum board size of 10x11 (with the 11th row being the sum row).
